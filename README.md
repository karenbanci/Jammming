# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#Create a Playlist App With the Spotify API (Part One)
In this project, you will build a React web application called Jammming. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

We’ve broken the Jammming project into 13 sections. Each section contains a descriptive header with an introductory step followed by a set of steps that guide you to the outcome. The first step of each section will explain the goal and provide a brief overview of how we’ll accomplish it. Before you start the second step, try to plan how you would complete the section. As you finish the rest of the steps, reflect on how your solution compares to ours.

This is a long project, but we’ll be with you every step of the way. Whether you’re completing assessments without the additional steps or banging your head against the wall trying to understand a hint, always use best practices and reflect on your growth. If you get stuck or just want to see how a seasoned developer tackles this project, click “get help” to see a walkthrough video.

Good luck!

[Update December 2020: We’ve noticed that some learners outside of the United States are unable to create a Spotify account. While we work on this issue, you may try other music APIs that support GET and POST request or skip the project for now. Other APIs can be found on this page or this page. You’ll need to adjust steps 74-95 accordingly.]
